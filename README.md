## 🚀 Technologies Used

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Users sign in** and receive a unique account  
2. **Vehicle data** (make, model, mods, stats) is stored in the backend  
3. **Images** are linked to vehicles  
4. **Garage cards** render all saved builds
5. On app relaunch, data reloads from the API

This ensures cars are:
- Persistent  
- User-scoped  
- Offline-safe
